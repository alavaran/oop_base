# 🏦 Banking System Project

A multi-tier object-oriented banking system built with Python, featuring account management, transaction processing, audit trails, reporting capabilities, and extensible architecture.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Develop a comprehensive banking platform that demonstrates advanced OOP principles through modular design. The system includes account models, transaction processing, audit mechanisms, analytical reporting, data validation, and security features.

**Duration:** 7 development stages + final integration

## ✨ Key Features

The platform supports:

- 💳 Multiple bank account types with distinct behaviors
- 🔄 Account operations with comprehensive logging and audit trails
- 🏦 Centralized client management system
- 📜 Extended transaction history with metadata (date, type, status, comments)
- 📊 Analytical report generation
- ✅ Data validation and error handling framework
- 🔧 Extensible architecture for future account types and operations

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

The project implements core object-oriented programming concepts:

- 📦 **Encapsulation** — Protected data access through well-defined interfaces
- 🧬 **Inheritance** — Hierarchical class structures for accounts and clients
- 🔄 **Polymorphism** — Type-specific behavior for different account classes
- 🎭 **Abstraction** — Abstract base classes defining contracts
- 🏗️ **SOLID Principles** — Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- 🏢 **Domain Modeling** — Business logic representation through objects
- 📝 **Structured Logging** — Comprehensive operation tracking
- 🧪 **Testability** — Modular design supporting unit testing
